### **Description**

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

### **Input**

The first (and the only) input line contains integer number $w\ (1 \leq w \leq 100)$ the weight of the watermelons bought by boys.

### **Output**

Print $YES$, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and $NO$ in the opposite case.

### **Examples**

###### **Input**

```number
8
```

###### **Output**

```text
YES
```

Focus on the second paragraph of description, especially on "... they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal." The objective is dividing the watermelon weight into two parts that is each of them must be an even number and they not necessarily have to be equal. In other words, the weight of watermelon must be even and more than 2. For examples, 2 kilos can't be divided into 2 parts that both have an even weights in kilos. On the other hand, 6 kilos, can be divided into 2 kilos and 4 kilos which means it can be divided into two parts that each of them is even and not equal.

Additionally, the input is $w$ which is the weight of watermelon bought by them in range $1\ \leq w \leq 100$ of kilos and the output is $\text{"}YES\text{"}$ if the objectives have passed. Otherwise, the output should be $\text{"}NO\text{"}$.

So, first of all we need a variable that can store the input. In this case i gave the name of variable is $w$ with the short as type of data because the range just until 100 that is enough to store on type data short $\text{(}\approx(\pm \ (3\times10^4)\  / \ \pm\ (2^{15} - 1))\text{)}$. After that, check $w$ by if else function with condition `w > 2` for checking the $w$ is more than 2 kilos or not and `w % 2 == 0` for checking whether $w$ is even. Don't forget to add the and operation `&&`. For the true result is `YES`, in the opposite case is `NO`. The final syntax for the if else function is:

```cpp
if(w > 2 && w % 2 == 0) cout << "YES";
else cout << "NO";
```

Fun fact: Instead of using modulo operator, you can use Bitwise Manipulation too for checking whether a number is even as showed below:

```cpp
if(w > 2 && !(w & 1)) cout << "YES";
else cout << "NO";
```

The final answer is:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	short w;
	cin >> w;

	if(w > 2 && w % 2 == 0) cout << "YES";
	else cout << "NO";

	return 0;
}
```

or

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	short w;
	cin >> w;

	if(w > 2 && !(w & 1)) cout << "YES";
	else cout << "NO";

	return 0;
}
```
